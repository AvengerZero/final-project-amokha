# Creative Project 4 Specification
## Overview
For your fourth (and final!) Creative Project, you will create your own Node.js web service available for use
with AJAX and fetch. Once again, as a Creative Project, you have
freedom to have more ownership in your work, as long as you meet the requirements listed below.

## Ideas for CP4
Being that this is our last Creative Project, it is also your
chance to wrap up your work in CSE 154 with a final portfolio you can
publish, showcasing your exploration of web programming technologies. As always, we encourage you to explore the new material covered in class, as well as related (but optional) content we may link to along the way, as long as you follow the CSE 154 Code Quality Guidelines and adhere to Academic Integrity policies. In past quarters, some students have built upon their Creative Project each week. You may choose to do a new website for each CP, or build on the existing project from previous CP's.

As long as you meet the requirements outlined below, you have freedom in what kind of website you create. Here are some ideas for Summer 2019 (you can also [check out](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19sp/creative/cp-showcase.html#cp4) Spring 2019's CP4 Showcase to see other creative ways students used their own APIs in their websites!):

* Recall that one of the benefits of writing functions in Node.js instead of code you
can write in JS on the client side is that you can quickly process data with file I/O. While you are
not required to use file I/O in this CP, it can help create a pretty useful API.
As an idea, consider writing your own folders and files to process and
return data in JSON format in your API (e.g. see the random recipe generator
exercise from section, where we created a small collection of `txt` files to process
in the response).
* We've primarily practiced processing txt files and directory contents, but
depending on your own interests and project focus, you can process other files
like `.csv`, `.gcode` (3D coordinate files for
[3D Printing models](https://benjaminjurke.com/content/articles/2015/gcode-primer/)), `.pdb`
(protein code [encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format))), etc.
* This CP is designed to give you an opportunity to practice writing both client (JS) and server-side (Node.js)
  code on your website. This is a great chance to think about how your project could showcase what
  you've learned so far in web programming for your own code portfolio after the quarter ends, so
  we encourage you to explore implementing different features of your web service!


## External Requirements
* Your project must include the following six files at a minimum:
  * `index.html` - main page of your website
  * `styles.css` - file to style your `.html` file
  * `index.js` - containing your client-side JavaScript code
  * **new:** a `app.js` web service your .js file fetches from with at least two different GET requests.
  * **new:** a `APIDOC.md` file to document your `app.js` web service.
  * **new:** your project's `package.json` file generated using `npm init` and including any dependencies you use (at minimum `express`). Remember that you should never directly edit this file, as `npm` will update it as needed.


**Important Note**: all static "view" files (HTML/CSS/Client-side JS/any images) should be inside a "public" folder as discusseed in class. All other files (e.g. your Node.js/Express web service) should be at the root. DO NOT push `node_modules` in your cp4-node-api repo. We will run `npm install` using your submitted `package.json` to install the modules necessary for your project.

* Similar to HW4, you will be writing both client-side JS and Node.js to incorporate in your website, where your `index.js`
  makes AJAX requests to **your** Node.js web service which responds with information.
* Client-Side JavaScript: Your website must somehow dynamically load information from the web API you've implemented and
present information from that response on the page. This requires that you must:
    * Respond to some event (whether it's the window `load` event, any UI event, or, a timer event)
    to determine when to fetch the data (using `fetch`), and
    * Dynamically integrate the data returned from your API into the page by
    manipulating the DOM elements of the page in some non-trivial way using
    `element.appendChild`, `element.removeChild`, or
    `element.replaceChild`, and
  * Use the `checkStatus` function from lecture/section to throw an Error if the fetch response status is not `ok` before processing the data (see [this example](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/lectures/lec12-ajax-fetch/index.html#ajax-fetch-skeleton)). This is a helper function we are allowing (encouraging) you to use (with JSDoc) in your AJAX programs, but the rest of your functions must be your own.
  * Handle any errors caused in the fetch request/response process by displaying a helpful message to the user on the page (i.e. without using `alert`, `console.log` or `console.error`). To do so, you should define a function (e.g. `handleError`) to implement the error-message-displaying and pass that function the `fetch` call chain's `catch` statement. You may use an equivalent AJAX solution in `index.js` with `async`/`await` and `try`/`catch` if you would like, though it's not required.

* **new:** Your Node.js web service should handle at least two **different** endpoints, one of which outputs JSON and one which outputs plain text.
  * Details: You may choose to implement two GET endpoints and have an optional query parameter of `type` or `format` to let a client choose their returned format as text or JSON, or you may choose to implement one endpoint that always returns text and one endpoint that always returns JSON. You may also choose to have multiple GET parameters (optional or required) per query to support each of your requests (refer to different request parameters supported by other public APIs for ideas!)
  * Your Node.js must handle at least one invalid request with a 400 error header (with content type set
    as plain text or JSON) and a descriptive
  message as demonstrated in lecture/section (although you are encouraged to handle more than one type of invalid request). Possible
  errors include missing required GET query parameters or passing invalid values for
   parameters (whether they are path or query parameters). Remember that a missing path parameter will not be appropriate to handle, since the Express route will always require the parameter is passed to match the path string. You may include other error codes as well, but must support at least one 400 (invalid client request) error for full credit.
  * You may implement other types of Node.js responses for more practice before HW4. In particular, we
    encourage you to practice with file/directory processing with the `fs` module and `async/await`.
  * Document your API in [`APIDOC.md`](APIDOC.md). A sample of what your documentation should look like is in [`APIDOC-sample.md`](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/resources/assets/apidoc/APIDOC-sample.md). A `.md` file is written in Markdown, documentation on which
  is [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/markdown.html).

## Internal Requirements
For full credit, your page must not only match the External Requirements listed above, you must also
demonstrate that you understand what it means to write code following a set of programming standards.
Your code should maintain good code quality by following the
  [CSE154 Code Quality Guide](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/_site/). Make sure to review the section specific to JavaScript! We also expect you to implement relevant feedback from previous assignments. Some guidelines that are particularly important to remember for this assignment are included below.

### HTML/CSS
* Continue to follow the standards for your HTML/CSS, including consistent whitespace/indentation, proper use of classes/ids, separation of languages, avoiding redundancy in CSS, etc.
* HTML and CSS files must be well-formed and pass W3C validation.

### JS
* Continue to follow the standards in the JS Code Quality Guidelines and CP2/HW2/CP3/HW3 specs. This includes good use of function decomposition, separation of JS from HTML/CSS, minimizing module-global variables, etc. A few reminders of Code Quality requirements for JS so far:
* Any `.js` code you write must declare `"use strict";` at the top
* All client-side JS must use the module-global pattern (remember that you should not use this module pattern in `app.js` though)
* Define program constants with `UPPER_CASED` naming conventions (using `const` instead of `let` in JS). Examples of common program constants include a  file path to your images if you are working with many images in your JS or an API base url as demonstrated in class).
* Decompose your JS by writing smaller, more generic functions that complete one task rather than a few larger "do-everything" functions. Limit your use of anonymous functions - meaningful behavior should be factored out with a named function.
* Localize your variables as much as possible. You should not use any global variables (outside the module pattern) - see [Code Quality Guide](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/_site/javascript/#module-pattern) for reference. Only use module-global variables whenever absolutely necessary. Do not store DOM element objects, such as those returned by the `document.getElementById` function, as module-global variables.
* Limit your use of anonymous functions - meaningful behavior should be factored out with a named function
* Do not make unnecessary requests to your API. That is, there should be no code in your JS that requests from an API and **never** does anything with the response.
* Your JS code must pass [JSLint](https://oxford.cs.washington.edu/cse154/jslint/) with no errors.

**New CP4-Specific Requirements** (in addition to following the Node.js section of the Code Quality Guide):
* Your Node.js web service should specify the correct content type by setting the header using a consistent convention before outputting and response (this includes 400 errors). These headers should only be set when necessary and should not be overridden.
* Your Node.js code should not generate any HTML (though you may check with instructors for exceptions to this rule depending on the context of your project)
* Similar to your client-side JS, decompose your Node.js/Express API by writing smaller, more generic functions that complete one task rather
than a few larger "do-everything" functions - no function should be more than 30 lines of code, and your Node.js should have _at least_ one helper function defined and used. Consider factoring out important behavior for your different GET requests into functions.

### All
Requirements continuing from previous CP/HW assignments:
* Your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js should demonstrate consistent and readable source code aesthetics as demonstrated in class
and detailed in the [CSE 154 Code Quality Guidelines](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/_site/). Part of your grade will come from using consistent indentation, proper
naming conventions, curly brace locations, etc.
* Place a comment header in each file with your name, section, and a brief description of the file (examples have been given on previous assignments)
* If you want to explore other HTML/CSS/JS features beyond what we've taught in class, you must cite what resources you used to learn them in order to be eligible for credit. We strongly encourage students to ask the staff for resources instead of finding online tutorials on their own (some are better than others).

**New CP4-Specific Requirements** (in addition to following the Node.js section of the Code Quality Guide):
* Document your Node.js functions using the same JSDoc requirements as your client-side JS file (e.g. `@param` and `@return`).  
* Briefly document any request-handling functions (e.g. `app.get`, `app.post`, etc.) with comments about the endpoint. If you use anonymous functions for your callback, these comments should be more descriptive. If you use named functions for your callback, you can rely more on the named function JSDoc.
* Include a  description of your Node.js web service and the parameters/responses that
  would be important for you/other developers to understand the program. See the
  Code Quality Guide for an example. Use your `APIDOC.md` for a more descriptive public documentation of your API (used by clients).  

## Grading
This CP will be out of 8 points and will likely be distributed as:
* External Correctness (4 pts)
* Internal Correctness (3 pts)
* Documentation (1 pt)

## Late Day Challenge
You can earn one extra late day for successfully adding a form (in a `<form>` tag) to your site that
includes a way to "submit" the information to the server. Upon submit, the form uses
the `FormData` object and AJAX Fetch with a POST request to retrieve, then modify the site in a "non-trivial" way. Our definition of "non-trivial" is that it must dynamically integrate the data returned from the API into the page by manipulating the DOM elements (similar to the base assignment using `element.appendChild`, `element.removeChild`, or
`element.replaceChild`), and you must appropriately handle errors.

## Academic Integrity
Creative Projects are unique in that students may look for outside resources for inspiration or assistance in accomplishing their goals. On occasion students may wish to use portions of sample code that has been obtained on our course website or others. In order to avoid academic misconduct for a Creative Project in CSE 154 you must:
1. Ensure that substantive original work is submitted that can be evaluated by the course staff.
2. Cite the ideas or materials of others that are used. The citation format is not that important - as long as the source material can be located and the citation verified (a url in a comment is generally fine), it's OK.
3. Clearly indicate (e.g. with comments) which portions of your code are completely original and
which are used or modified from external sources, if any code is used that builds off of/is
inspired by external sources (e.g. adaption of an example CSE 154 exercise, online tutorial
you find on Bootstrap or a JS library, etc.). We will only grade your original work. Note
 that solely changing identifier names or rearranging other source material is not considered
 your original work - see the syllabus of appropriate use for more details.

Students with questions about any specific situation should ask the instructor for clarification.
